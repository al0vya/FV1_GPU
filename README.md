1D finite volume solver for the shallow water equations, Harten, Lax and van Leer approximate Riemann solver.

Parallelised using CUDA, for which a CUDA compatible NVIDIA graphics card is necessary. The CUDA Toolkit (version 10.1 or higher) must also be installed.

6 test cases are available and the only user input is to specifiy the number of elements on the mesh.
